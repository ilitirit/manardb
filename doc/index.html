      <h2>Fast, persistent Lisp object serialisation</h2>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    
    <p> Manardb provides persistent classes (integrated into the
      object system via the meta-object protocol), stored efficiently
      in memory mapped regions. It features transactions, two
      different garbage collection mechanisms (to clean up
      unreferenced objects in the datastore), in-place modification of
      arrays, efficient in-place numeric typed slots, and the ability
      to transparently serialise Lisp objects of many types (lists,
      vectors, floats, integers, symbols, strings).</p>

    <p>It allows Common Lisp programs to efficiently access in-memory
    representations of large numbers of persistent objects without
    putting pressure on the Lisp garbage collector.</p>

    <h3> Concurrency </h3>

    <p>Multiple concurrent readers and writers can access the database
      without problems; both multiple threads and multiple processes
      work fine. However, they have to either arrange not allocate new
      objects (by using fixed-size numeric-typed slots, and
      fixed-length strings) or ensure via some locking mechanism that
      only one thread can allocate at a time, and all processes update
      their mappings after an allocation. Additionally, they must
      ensure that writers do not conflict together or confuse
      readers.</p>

    <p> Alternatively, they could use the race free transaction
      support. (Readers continue to refer to an old snapshot until
      they explicitly reload the database.)</p>
      
      <h3> Efficiency </h3>

      <p> According to our benchmarks, when instantiating a object
	with two slots one million times, manardb is about seven times
	faster than AllegroCache 2.1.1 on Allegro 8.1, and about fifteen
	times faster than AllegroCache on SBCL 1.0.31. It is more than
	ten times faster to iterate over the 1M objects created and sum
	the values of one numeric slot on Allegro Lisp, and about one
	hundred times faster on SBCL.</p>

      <h3> Portability </h3>

      <p>Manardb works on Common Lisp implementations on Linux. We
      have tested SBCL 1.0.31 and Allegro 8.1, and lightly tested
      Lispworks and ClozureCL.

      <p>It uses the mremap system call so is restricted to Linux. It
      would be trivial to change the mremap to a munmap, followed by
      mmap on other UN*X like platforms, as manardb is already
      prepared for the base address of the mapping to change.

    <h3> Using it </h3>

    <p> Start
      Lisp. Get <a href="http://www.cliki.net/ASDF-Install">asdf-install</a>.
    </p>

    <pre>
      CL-USER> (asdf-install:install 'manardb)
      CL-USER> (asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op 'manardb)
    </pre>

    <pre>
CL-USER&gt; (defclass foo ()
  ((next :initform nil)
   (val :initarg :val :accessor foo-val :type (unsigned-byte 32)))
  (:metaclass manardb:mm-metaclass))
#&lt;MM-METACLASS FOO&gt;
</pre>

    <h3>Future directions</h3>

    <p>manardb is just starting out. It hasn't tapped the full
    potential of this approach. There are many ways to improve it.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Indexing</li>
      <li>Storage of more complex types: union types, enumerated types,
	variable length objects, interface to the ability to store directly
	store arrays of instances of user-defined class (instead of
	an array of pointers to such instances), etc.</li>
      <li>Storage of more Lisp types: multidimensional arrays, complex
	numbers, bignums, characters, etc.</li>
      <li>More transparent shared access to arrays of unboxed
      types.</li>
      <li>Many MOP optimisations: generating custom accessor methods
	for memory mapped slots.</li>
      <li>Improve the whole-datastore garbage collector to use more memory
      efficient datastructures.</li>
    </ul>
