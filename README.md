ManarDB
=======

ManarDB is a performant Memory-Mapped storage allocation system based
on the common-lisp object system meta-object-protocol.

This is an enhanced fork of the original manardb distribution,
(version designation '0.1.20090911) that provides _support for **non-linux**
platforms_, compatibility with current releases of required libraries,
updates supporting most current common-lisp implementations, and a number of
miscellaneous fixes and feature enhancements.  It does not necessarily
seek to maintain backward compatibility with the API provided by the
original distribution in all cases.
                     
The primary goal of this branch is to provide a robust storage
management layer to support implementation of persistence and garbage
collection for higher-level data-structures -- principally at this
time focused on [CL-CTRIE](http://github.com/danlentz/cl-ctrie/tree/persistence/).
